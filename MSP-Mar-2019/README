Thank you for attending my talks at the Twin Cities Software Symposium
in Minneapolis, March 8th and 9th, 2019.

The sample code developed during the Spring Boot sessions on Friday can be found in the `boot-demo` folder here.

As for the Saturday sessions...

 - There was so little code developed during the Serverless Spring session, that it isn't worthwhile to create a folder here to show that off. The slides contain ever bit of code (and more) that was written during the session.
 - The code for the Spring Security+OAuth+JWT session can be found at https://github.com/habuma/spring-security-oauth2-jwt-example.
 - Most of the code from the Spring voice apps talk can be found at https://github.com/habuma/spring-skills. Some of the simpler stuff done at the beginning of the talk is based on the "Hello World" example created by the `ask new` command, and is cloned from https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world (although, yes, I tweaked it a bit during the talk...just not enough to justify checking it in here.)
